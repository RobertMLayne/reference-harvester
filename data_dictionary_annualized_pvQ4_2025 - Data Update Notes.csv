Q4 2025 date update
"The 2025 update now includes patent-level data for all granted patents through the end of 2024. The dataset continues to feature CPC and WIPO sector and field information, along with the comprehensive list of unique CPC/IPC/WIPO technology classifications in the “ipc_sections” variable, which replaces the former “ipc_section” variable by listing unique sections separated by spaces in the order displayed on the patent. All previously established variables have been retained."

Q4 2024 date update
"The June 2024 update now includes patent-level data for granted patents up to the end of 2023. In response to user requests, we've added CPC and WIPO sector and field information. We now also provide a comprehensive list of all unique CPC/IPC/WIPO technology classifications, replacing the former ""ipc_section"" variable. This new ""ipc_sections"" variable lists the unique sections, separated by spaces, in the order displayed on the patent. All previous variables have been retained except for the old ""ipc_section"" variable. To address user feedback about the confusion caused by partial-year data, we have moved to an annual update schedule every June, ensuring we provide complete patent information for the entire preceding year."

Q2 2023 data update
The March 2023 update includes patent-level data for years up to 2022 granted patents. This update includes all variables included in the original 2022 data release. 
"Not only does the 2023 update provide the most up-to-date patent data, we also include patent-assignee observations with missing information for maximal data retention. The 2023 datasets now include five new dummy variables (d_application, d_assignee, d_location, d_ipc and d_inventor), which indicates if the corresponding information is available for that patent-assignee observation. To duplicate the same dataset from the 2022 release, a user simply just has to filter on observations that equal 1 in all five of the new dummy variables. "
"In addition to the five dummy variables that indicates what kind of information is available for each observation, an additional dummy varialbe called assignee_ind was added to indicate whether the assignee is an individual, rather than a firm when assignee information is available. The 2022 datasets did not include this variable. "
"A small sample of patents do not have grant year information. These patents are stored separately in the data file titled ""year_missing"". The majority of these observations are very old patents and are likely not to be useful to the average user. However, we provide this information for users who maybe interested in studying these patents."

Q2 2022 
"March 2022 is the first instance of PatentsView publishing annualized datasets. Providing annualized datasets addresses several of our constitutents' request for a more user-friendly, patent-level data product that can be accessed with widely available spreadsheet software like microsoft excel.  A dataset is provided for every year starting in 1976-2021, when patent data was collected.Granted patents are thus organized into files based on their grant year.  "
"The annual datasets are unique at the patent-assignee observation level. While the vast majority of patents are assigned to only one assignee, some patents are listed as assigned to more than one assignee. The datasets include only patent-assignee observations for which full information about assignee, application, inventor, location and ipc information is available."
