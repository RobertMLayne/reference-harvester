Use this endpoint if you are interested in searching across multiple patents or applications. For example, you want to return all patents and applications that match your search term, such as Utility or Design. You can also use multiple search terms, such as “Patented AND Abandoned.” You can use any combination of the 100+ data attributes available and documented below.

Note: The other endpoints (such as Application Data, Continuity, etc.) should be used when you're using a specific application number to find more detailed information. For example, you want to return all the relevant application data about Application #14412875 or all continuity data for Application #10588979.
