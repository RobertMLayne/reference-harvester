Was this page helpful?
Conduct a search of all patent application bibliographic/front page and patent relevant data fields. This data is refreshed daily.

Use this endpoint if you are interested in searching across multiple patents or applications. For example, you want to return all patents and applications that match your search term, such as Utility or Design. You can also use multiple search terms, such as “Patented AND Abandoned.” You can use any combination of the 100+ data attributes available and documented below.

Note: The other endpoints (such as Application Data, Continuity, etc.) should be used when you're using a specific application number to find more detailed information. For example, you want to return all the relevant application data about Application #14412875 or all continuity data for Application #10588979.

Other details for using the Search endpoint:

If you don’t specify the field in which you want us to look for this search term, we will look for it across all application data (inventionTitle, patentNumber, applicationTypeLabelName, correspondenceAddressBag etc.) and return any matching patents or applications.

If you don’t specify which attributes you would like to see in the response related to the search term(s), it returns all data attributes.

All search syntaxes are applicable to this endpoint, meaning any number of combinations is possible. Some example requests are below, but for more information, view the Simplified Syntax documentation that is linked in the Open Data Portal API page. You can also test the API right away in Swagger UI swagger icon.

You can download the JSON Schema file to parse the JSON responses returned by the APIs.
